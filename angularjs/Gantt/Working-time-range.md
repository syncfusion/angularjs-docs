# Working time range

In Gantt control, working hours in a day for the project can be defined by using the **e-dayworkingtime** property. Based on the working hours, automatic date scheduling and duration validations for the task can be performed.

The following code snippet explains how to define the working time range for project in the Gantt control:

{% highlight javascript %}

<body ng-controller="GanttCtrl">
    <!--Add  Gantt control here-->
    <div id="GanttContainer" ej-gantt //... e-dayworkingtime="dayWorkingTime">
    </div>
    <script>
        var dayWorkingTime = [{
                "from": "08:00 AM",
                "to": "12:00 PM"
            },
            {
                "from": "01:00 PM",
                "to": "05:00 PM"
            }
        ];
        angular.module('listCtrl', ['ejangular'])
            .controller('GanttCtrl', function($scope) {
                //...
                $scope.dayWorkingTime = dayWorkingTime;
            });
    </script>
</body>

{% endhighlight %}

N> Individual tasks can lie between any time within the defined working time range of the project.

N> The **e-dayworkingtime** property is used to define the working time for the whole project.

The following demo explains the working time range in the Gantt control:

The following screenshot shows working time range in the Gantt control:

## Highlight working time range

Highlight the working time range with a background color by using the `e-dayworkingtime.background` property. You can highlight the non-working time ranges in a day. To do this, set the `e-highlightnonworkingtime` property to `true`. To customize the non-working time background, use the `e-nonworkingbackground` property.

The following code snippet explains how to define the working time range with background in Gantt.

{% highlight javascript %}
<body ng-controller="GanttCtrl">
    <!--Add  Gantt control here-->
    <div id="GanttContainer" ej-gantt e-highlightnonworkingtime="true" e-nonworkingbackground="#B7C3D0" e-dayworkingtime="dayWorkingTime" //...>
    </div>
    <script>
        var dayWorkingTime = [{
                "from": "08:00 AM",
                "to": "12:00 PM",
                background: "#EBF5FB"
            },
            {
                "from": "01:00 PM",
                "to": "05:00 PM",
                background: "#EBF5FB"
            }
        ];
        angular.module('listCtrl', ['ejangular'])
            .controller('GanttCtrl', function($scope) {
                //...
                $scope.dayWorkingTime = dayWorkingTime;
            });
    </script>
</body>
{% endhighlight %}

N> The background colors of working time range are highlighted only when the `e-scheduleheadersettings.scheduleHeaderType` value as `ej.Gantt.ScheduleHeaderType.Day`.

The following screenshot shows the working time range with background colors.
