TreeView state can be persisted by using [enablePersistence](http://help.syncfusion.com/api/js/ejtreeview#members:enablepersistence). In which entire modal has been persisted excluding data source in order to maintain performance. 

The model values of below are maintained through Id basis of tree node.
