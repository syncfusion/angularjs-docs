# Drag and Drop

By default `allowDragAndDrop` is true.Cards can be transited from one column to another column, by dragging and dropping. And it has drop position indicator which enables easier positioning of cards

N> To transit cards to other swim lanes through Drag and Drop, please refer [here](https://help.syncfusion.com/angularjs/kanban/swimlanes#drag-and-drop-between-swim-lanes).

## Prioritization of cards

Prioritizing cards is easy with drag-and-drop re-ordering that helps you to categorize most important work at the top.Cards can be categorized with priority by mapping specific database field into `priority` property.

`RankId` defined in the dataSource which is consist priority of cards. The `RankId` will be changed while card ordering changes through `Drag and Drop` and `Editing`.

The following code example describes the above behavior.

            angular.module('KanbanApp', ['ejangular'])
                .controller('KanbanCtrl', function ($scope) {
                    $scope.data = new ej.DataManager(window.kanbanData).executeLocal(ej.Query().take(30));
                });
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
