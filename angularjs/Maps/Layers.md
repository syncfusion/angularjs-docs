# Layers

Map is maintained through `e-layers` and it can accommodate one or more layers.

## Multilayer

The Multilayer support allows you to load multiple shape files in a single container, enabling maps to display more information.

### Adding Multiple Layers in the Map

The shape layers is the core layer of the map. The multiple layers can be added in the shape layers as `e-subLayers` within the shape layers.

## SubLayer

The subLayer is the collection of shape layers. 

In this example, World Map shape is used as shape data by utilizing the “**WorldMap.json**” file in the following folder structure obtained from downloaded Maps_GeoJSON folder.

..\ Maps_GeoJSON\

You can assign the complete contents in “**WorldMap.json**” file to new JSON object. For better understanding, a JS file “**WorldMap.js”** is already created to store JSON data in JSON object “usMap”

**[usa.js]**

{% highlight javascript %}

    var world_map = //Paste all the content copied from the JSON file// 

{% endhighlight %}
